Hi!  I'm an economist and data scientist based in the Chicago-area, but most of the projects on this Github don't have much to do with that.  It has some statistics projects but it also has a lot of fun programming projects that don't really have much to do with statistics or economics:

1. [SLOBIL](https://github.com/flynnzac/slobil).  A programming language I wrote on the bus to work from circa 2018-2019 to present that I made the mistake of actually using so it has gotten seriously out of hand for a hobbyist language.  It has a command-like, TCL-ish syntax with a heavy focus on being easy to use interactively (i.e. from the REPL).  Many "programs" in the language are just collections of operators you can use in the REPL.

2. [Leas](https://github.com/flynnzac/leas). A flexible interactive command-line program for managing personal finances.  It is extensible with Guile, a dialect of Scheme/Lisp, which you can use to do things like update the value of your mutual fund holdings, etc.

3. [genvar](https://github.com/flynnzac/genvar). An R package that lets you use clean data, etc, in a more "imperative" way, ala Stata.

4. [subtitle_er](https://github.com/flynnzac/subtitle_er).  A python script to create MPlayer-compatible subtitle files from video using OpenAI's whisper package.
